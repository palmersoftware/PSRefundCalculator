## CSV Format Requirements

Your CSV file should have the following columns. If your column names are different, update the script variables at the top of the PowerShell file to match:

| Script Variable         | Expected Column Name in CSV      | Description                                      |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| $colOrder              | Order #                          | The order number for each purchase               |
| $colItemName           | Item Name                        | The name of the item ordered                     |
| $colRecipient          | Recipient                        | The customer or recipient of the order           |
| $colQuantity           | Quantity                         | Number of items in the order                     |
| $colOrderTotal         | Order Total                      | Total cost of the order (excluding shipping)     |
| $colShippingPaid       | Shipping Paid                    | Amount paid by the customer for shipping         |
| $colTotalShippingPaid  | Total Shipping Paid              | Sum of shipping paid for all orders by recipient |
| $colShippingCost       | Shipping Cost                    | Actual shipping cost for the order               |
| $colRefundAmount       | Refund amount                    | Amount to refund to the customer                 |

> **Important:** If your CSV uses different column names, you must update the script variables at the top of the PowerShell file to match your file headers exactly. Otherwise, the app will not work correctly.

## Application Layout Notes

- The app's layout logic ensures the Data and Stats tables are hidden on startup and only shown after loading data.
- Duplicate control additions and repeated panel positioning have been eliminated for a cleaner UI.
- If you customize the UI, ensure each control is only added once and positioned as needed.
- The top panel and tab controls are added to the form a single time, and their positions are set for clarity and maintainability.

## Tips

- If you see "Working On It..." when loading files, try running the app in a regular PowerShell window (not inside VS Code).
- Dollar signs and other symbols in shipping fields are OKâ€”the app will ignore them for calculations.
