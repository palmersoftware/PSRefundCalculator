## Table Columns (CSV Format)

Your CSV file should have the following columns, and the script variables must reference the exact column names as they appear in your file. If your column names are different, you must update the script variables to match:

| Script Variable         | Expected Column Name in CSV      | Description                                      |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| $colOrder              | Order #                          | The order number for each purchase               |
| $colItemName           | Item Name                        | The name of the item ordered                     |
| $colRecipient          | Recipient                        | The customer or recipient of the order           |
| $colQuantity           | Quantity                         | Number of items in the order                     |
| $colOrderTotal         | Order Total                      | Total cost of the order (excluding shipping)     |
| $colShippingPaid       | Shipping Paid                    | Amount paid by the customer for shipping         |
| $colTotalShippingPaid  | Total Shipping Paid              | Sum of shipping paid for all orders by recipient |
| $colShippingCost       | Shipping Cost                    | Actual shipping cost for the order               |
| $colRefundAmount       | Refund amount                    | Amount to refund to the customer                 |

> **Important:** If your CSV uses different column names, you must update the script variables at the top of the PowerShell file to match your file headers exactly. Otherwise, the app will not work correctly.

## Tips

- If you see "Working On It..." when loading files, try running the app in a regular PowerShell window (not inside VS Code).
- Dollar signs and other symbols in shipping fields are OKâ€”the app will ignore them for calculations.
